# Marketing Markdown File Creation Plan

## Objective
Create a comprehensive marketing markdown file for the antihq/password application landing page.

## Target Audience
- Teams and small businesses

Organize features into logical categories:
- Password Management (store, generate, search, notes)
- Credit Card Management (store, brand detection, security)
- Team Collaboration (teams, invitations, access control)
- Authentication & Security (2FA, encryption, sessions, API)
- User Experience (PWA, themes, device login, profile)

Each feature will have:

### 3. Use Cases
4-5 detailed scenarios:
